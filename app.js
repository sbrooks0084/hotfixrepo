// I want good control flow and function encapsulation for this project. 
// I don't want just lines and lines of code written in the global scope or in one huge function.

// When page loads, make a get request that gets all users and creates divs for each user. 
    // Each user div should have the users name, username, and city they are located in.
    // when a div is clicked on, it should fetch all posts associated with the user id.

const container = document.querySelector('#container')

// example()

// function example() {
//     $.get([some url here], [some callback function that gets access to data here])
// }
